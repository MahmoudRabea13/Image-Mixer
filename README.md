# Image-Mixer :art:
as simple as 
importing two images -> choosing magnitude or phase of each image -> minpulating and mixing the various phases and magnitudes :man_shrugging: 

#### this project was built by python Flask as the main backend language alongside with JavaScript , HTML and CSS as frontend languages

## Key features:

1. mix two images
2. select or cut from the phase&magnitude spectrum  
3. Applying low-pass & high-pass [Discrete inverse Fourier Transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_Fourier_transform) **diff**


## Project Description:

### 1. mix two images:

#### upload two images and mix between the magnitude of one and the phase of the other
*Note that the default case is the first image's magnitude and the second's phase*

#### mix certain parts of images' magnitudes and phases

#### Pick between two modes:
###### A. Select the specified box and cut everything else
###### B. cut the specified box and select everything else

### 2. select or cut from the phase&magnitude spectrum:

#### select or cut from the phase spectrum

#### select or cut from the magnitude spectrum

### 3. Applying Low-pass&High-pass pass diff:

#### Low pass diff

#### High pass diff
